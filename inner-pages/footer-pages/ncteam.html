Everyone can voice their opinions and concerns without any intrusion. <br> <br> Apart from the daily in-house lunch for all, Nazreen embraces the hard work of its team members with additional treats and surprises. Team lunches are often arranged after the successful completion of projects, which boosts the morale and provides a feeling of self recognition among the employees. <br> <br> When it comes to mentoring, Nazreen has the best mentors on board. With our COO being a female, the women in the workforce can approach her, or any other higher authorities at all times. Be it a matter of work conflict, or a personal work-life balance issue, guidance is guaranteed. This mentoring is not limited to the females, but the males are equally encouraged to discuss and seek advice at any time, for a wholesome environment. <br> <br> We believe that “Work doesn’t work without play”. For balancing work with life, recreational activities like Table Tennis Tournaments and Annual Picnics are organized for the staff with the best of facilities and resources, making sure that all the employees including the females rejoice and relish the events, in a safe and secure way. <br> <br> Our team members are often invited by different universities and educational institutes as external evaluators for the Final Year Projects, and for conducting valuable sessions for the tech industry’s future assets. Genetech also has been a part of the recent Job Fairs at few reputed universities. This all adds to the personal growth of the employee, boost their confidence and develop integration amongst the associates.</p></div>
