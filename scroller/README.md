State of the project
====================
This library its being used in production at Salesforce since 2013 (altough we have done some minor fixes in an internal branch over the years). Performance is still awesome tough! :)

Due to time constraints, it's been a while since I haven't have the time to maintain it properly, so don't expect much activity on this repo (nor expect any bug fixes any time soon).

Hopefully the examples and docs are enough to get you started.

I promise one of this days will give it a big rebump at make it even better!
